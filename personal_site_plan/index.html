            <h3>How to start knitting – Circular needles or straight needles?
            </h3>
            <img src="images/home3.jpg" alt="tejer con agujgas circular" >
            <h4>What are circular needles and how are they different from straight ones?</h4>
            <p>
                Straight needles are individual, separate needles, while circular needles include a cable between them to create seamless circular garments.

The main difference is this: when we knit with straight needles, as we turn the needles in each row, we alternately see the right and wrong sides of the garment. In the case of circular knitting we always see the same thing, on the outside of the needles the right side of the work and on the inside the wrong side.</p>
<ul>
    Advantages of circular needles that knitters comment on:

<li> They are small, light and easy to carry anywhere. And some say that if they knit continental, they find them more comfortable to work with.</li>
<li>You can knit on a table and not carry the weight of the wool . This helps in posture for those who suffer from back or arm ailments. By working in a circular motion, they allow you to knit tubular projects without making many of the seams.</li>
<li>The cable can be of different lengths: generally between 20 cm and 150 cm, allowing large projects to be knitted.</li>
